# Biography

I am currently a Deep Learning Researcher and Computer Vision Developer at [Faraadid Co](http://www.faraadid.com/VisitorPages/default.aspx?itemid=3). I received my M.Sc. from Machine Learning and Robotics Laboratory of [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/) under supervision of Dr. S. Shiry, where I worked on the application of Riemannian geometry in the field of Brain-computer interfaces. I also did my B.Sc. project under supervision of Dr. A. Kesharvarz at the Persian Gulf University of Bushehr in the field of image processing.
